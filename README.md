# kvittr

This is Erika Adele Sandbæk and Marte Jørgensens exam project.
The task was to create a "copy" of Twittr. 
On the website you can register as a user (bird), you can not register with an already existing username and/or email. Then you can log in and when you are logged in you can change your first name, last name and email address on your profile. You can also post messages (pips) when you are logged in. It is also possible to like and see the details for the pips on the page.

Our process:

We've had some struggles and therefore we have created 6-7 different versions of the project before we managed to create a functional and "flawless" copy of Twittr. Therefore we were able to create the final one fast and easy.

We've worked together with the whole project and maked sure that the two of us was getting lots of commits to GitHub.

PS: MarteCash and Marte Jørgensen is the same person.
