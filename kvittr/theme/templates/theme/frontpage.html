	    Fly free, little bird!
</p> <br/>
<p>
	Hope is the thing with feathers <br/> 
That perches in the soul,  <br/>
And sings the tune without the words, <br/> 
And never stops at all,  <br/><br/>
   
And sweetest in the gale is heard;   <br/>       
And sore must be the storm  <br/>
That could abash the little bird  <br/>
That kept so many warm.<br/><br/>

     â€“from "Hope is the thing with feathers" by Emily Dickinson
